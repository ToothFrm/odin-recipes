            <h2>Description</h2>
            These warm, spicy, not-too-sweet biscuits are rich in molasses, which substitutes sugar entirely in this recipe and is what also gives them their deep brown colouring and mellow, balsamic-like flavour. They are named for the presence of pevare, or pepper, in Venetian dialect – this is white pepper to be precise – and often the recipe is accompanied by other spices too, such as cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. You could use a combination of them here too. Originally, these would have been made with lard in place of the butter or sometimes brushed with a sticky glaze of simple syrup when coming out of the oven.

            <ul><h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <li>350 g (12½ oz/2⅓ cups plain (all-purpose) flour)</li>
                <li>1½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
                <li>1½ teaspoons ground white pepper</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
                <li>250 g (9 oz/ ¾ cup) molasses</li>
                <li>75 g (2¾ oz/⅓ cup) unsalted butter, softened</li>
                <li>juice of ½ lemon</li>
                <li>1 egg</li>
                <li>cocoa powder, for dusting</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Steps</h1>

            <div class="step"><h3>Step 1</h3>

            <p>Place all the dry ingredients, except for the cocoa powder, in a large bowl. In a separate bowl, beat the molasses, the butter and lemon juice until caramel-like. Add the egg then stir (I like a wooden spoon or a fork) into the flour mixture until you have a well-combined dough. </p></div>

            <div class="step"><h3>Step 2</h3>

            Rest the dough for 30 minutes in the fridge, or even overnight.</div>

            <div class="step"><h3>Step 3</h3>

            When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F). Then, on a clean surface such as a wooden board, roll the dough to about 5 mm (1/4 in) thick (dust it beforehand with cocoa powder if it is sticky; this will help, like flour, for it to not stick but the colour blends in better).</div>

            <div class="step"><h3>Step 4</h3>

            Cut into diamonds approximately 5 cm (2 in) wide and place, spaced well apart, on a baking sheet lined with baking paper. Bake for 15 minutes, or until the biscuits are slightly puffed and dry on top.</div>

            <div class="step"><h3>Step 5</h3>

            Cool on a wire baking tray. They keep well stored in an airtight container for up to 3 weeks.</div>

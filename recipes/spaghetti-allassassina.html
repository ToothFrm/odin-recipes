            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>(Largely copied from the original site)</p>
            <p>There's something a little bit suspicious about the origin story of this "to die for" pasta's name. Sure, a customer jokingly asking the chef if they're trying to "kill them" with this intensely flavored Spaghetti all'Assassina is sort of believable, but I've always felt like there was much more to the story.</p>

            <p>Anyway, regardless of the real story, this spicy, partially pan-fried spaghetti dish is as unusual as it is addictively delicious. As the head assassin, you get to decided exactly how spicy and charred this gets, but the sweetness and acidity of the caramelized tomato sauce balances the heat from the chili flakes, so don't worry about using a heavy hand.</p>

            <p class="side-note">I have no idea if this recipe is tasty or not, but it sure is spicy.</p>

            <div class="step"><h3>Step 1</h3>

            <p>Gather all ingredients.</p></div>

            <div class="step"><h3>Step 2</h3>

            <p>Heat olive oil in a pot over medium heat. Add garlic and sizzle until it starts to turn golden and fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in tomato puree, water, and salt. Bring to a simmer on medium-high. Once simmering, reduce to low heat and keep warm.</p></div>

            <div class="step"><h3>Step 3</h3>

            <p>Pour olive oil into a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat, season with chili flakes and heat until chili flakes start to sizzle, for 1 minute. Add raw spaghetti and toss until well coated with chili oil.</p></div>

            <div class="step"><h3>Step 4</h3>

            <p>Pour in about 3 cups of tomato broth and, using tongs, move pasta from side to side to evenly distribute tomato broth. Cook, occasionally moving pasta from side to side with tongs, all facing the same direction, until most of the broth has been absorbed or evaporated, and the spaghetti starts frying in the pan.</p></div>

            <div class="step"><h3>Step 5</h3>

            <p>Turn spaghetti over with tongs, and evenly arrange in the pan. Keep cooking until the pasta starts to brown, and even lightly chars.</p></div>

            <div class="step"><h3>Step 6</h3>

            <p>Add about 2 more cups of tomato broth, and repeat the process. Continue cooking until the spaghetti is as charred as you like , and cooked to your desired doneness. More broth can be added at the end of the process for a saucier version, as shown in the video, or it can be served relatively dry.</p></div>

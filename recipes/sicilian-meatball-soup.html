            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>One of the things I love about this Sicilian Meatball Soup recipe is the end result is so magically flavorful you could swear the recipe took the entire day to make.</p>
            
            <p>When in fact, it is fairly simple and doesn’t require much time at all!
                
            <p>Plus, the recipe is budget-friendly so you can make a big batch without it costing an arm and a leg.</p>
                
            <p>This hearty meatball soup recipe is loaded with fresh vegetables so that the meal tastes nice and fresh.</p>
                
            <p>The meatballs turn out so rich in flavor and have the absolute perfect texture. They also create a rich and flavorful broth so that the whole experience is an adventure for the taste buds!</p>
            
            <p>All things considered, this nutritious meal is a great source of complex carbohydrates, vitamins and fiber from the vegetables in addition to protein from the meat. </p>
            
            <p>I like using grass-fed ground beef to get some omega 3 fatty acids in there. If you’re going for less fat, use lean ground beef (90% lean or leaner) or ground turkey or ground game meat. </p>
            <p class="side-note">Weird combo of ingredients.</p>

            <h1>Steps</h1>

            <div class="step"><h3>Recipe tip:</h3>

            <p>Chop all of the vegetables ahead of time so that you can begin sautéing the onions, carrots, and celery while the meatballs are cooking..</p></div>

            <div class="superstep"><h3>Prepare the Meatballs:</h3></div>

                <div class="step"><h3>Step 1</h3>

                <p>Add all of the ingredients for the meatballs to a large mixing bowl. Stir everything together well until all of the ingredients are combined. Note: I use my hands to squish everything together. If you own a stand mixer, you can also mix the meat in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment.</p>

                </figure></div>

                <div class="step"><h3>Step 2</h3>

                <p>Form balls out of the meat mixture.</p></div>

                <div class="step"><h3>Step 3</h3>

                <p>Heat a large skillet over medium-high and add 1 to 2 tablespoons of avocado oil or olive oil. Once the skillet is hot, carefully place the meatballs on the hot surface and brown on two sides for 2 to 3 minutes each.</p>

            <div class="superstep"><h3>Make the Soup:</h3></div>
                While the meatballs are cooking, start the soup in a separate pot.

                <div class="step"><h3>Step 1</h3>

                <p>Add the chopped onion, carrots, and celery to a large stock pot (I use my Dutch oven) with 1 tablespoon of avocado oil or olive oil and heat over medium-high heat.</p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="../images/sicilian-meatball-soup/sicilian-meatball-soup-soup-1.jpg" alt="Chopped onion, carrots, and celery getting cooked in a large stock pot" width="600" height="400">

                </figure></div>
                
                <div class="step"><h3>Step 2</h3>

                <p>Allow the vegetables to cook, stirring occasionally, until they begin to soften, about 5 to 8 minutes (note: to speed up this process, sprinkle the vegetables with salt, stir well and cover the pot for a couple of minutes). </p></div>
                
                <div class="step"><h3>Step 3</h3>

                <p>Transfer the browned meat balls to the pot.</p>

                <div class="step"><h3>Step 4</h3>

                <p>Add in the remaining ingredients except for the zucchini and cabbage, and give everything a gentle stir. Cover the pot and bring the soup to a full boil.</p>

                <div class="step"><h3>Step 5</h3>

                <p>Once the soup reaches a boil, add the chopped zucchini and cabbage. Stir everything together, getting the cabbage to sink into the soup as best as possible.</p>

                <div class="step"><h3>Step 6</h3>

                <p>Cover the pot and reduce the heat to medium-low (or a gentle simmer). Cook, covered for 30 to 40 minutes. </p></div>
                
                <div class="step"><h3>Step 7</h3>

                <p>Serve soup in big bowls with rustic crusty bread, and enjoy!</p>

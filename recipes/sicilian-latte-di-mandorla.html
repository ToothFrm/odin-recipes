            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p class="side-note">(Original author's description)</p>
            <p>When I was a child, our pantry was full of these (very sugary and very industrial) syrups. On weekends, after the beach or the swimming pool, my siblings and I were allowed to pick a flavor, mix it with iced water, ingurgitate, and ask for more.</p>

            <p>At the time, unless living in Sicily, no one knew how to make almond milk from scratch.</p>

            <p>Nowadays, Italy is rediscovering traditions and is homemaking everything again. Many moms make almond milk in a blender or with a cheesecloth: it’s so much easier than they thought.</p>

            <p>Here’s the Sicilian Latte di Mandorla recipe to make your own delicious almond milk drink. You can stop at the unsweetened almond milk or add sugar (or honey) as desired.</p>

            <ul><h2>Ingredients:</h2>
                250 gr peeled almonds 
                1 lt water 
                4 tablespoons sugar (100 gr) <span class="info-on-ingredient">- optional - or substitute with honey</span>

            <div class="superstep"><h3>How to make almond milk without a blender:</h3></div>

                <div class="step"><h3>Step 1</h3>

                <p>Finely chop the almonds, place them in a cheesecloth and nod it.</p></div>

                <div class="step"><h3>Step 2</h3>

                <p>Bring the water to a boil, remove it from heat, insert the almond sack and infuse for 2 hours.</p></div>
                
                <div class="step"><h3>Step 3</h3>

                <p>Remove the cloth, and squeeze and drain water as much as possible.</p></div>

            <div class="superstep"><h3>How to make almond milk without a cheesecloth (or how to get a second batch):</h3></div>

                <div class="step"><h3>Step 1</h3>

                <p>If you don't have or don't want to use a cheesecloth, blend water and almonds for a few minutes at the maximum speed, then strain the liquids through a fine sieve.</p></div>

                <div class="step"><h3>Step 2</h3>

                <p>You may also have a second, less intense batch from the almonds you used to make almond milk without a blender: blend ½ liter (1/8 gallon) of water and the almonds you already used, for a few minutes, maximum speed. Strain through a fine sieve.</p></div>

            <div class="superstep"><h3>In both cases:</h3></div>

                <div class="step"><h3>Step 1</h3>
    
                <p>Add sugar and mix (hand blender, for best results).</p></div>

                <div class="step"><h3>Step 2</h3>

                <p>Refrigerate and serve cold.</p></div>
